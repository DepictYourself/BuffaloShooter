Buffalo hunting game

This is a turn based game. The buffaloes will try to run across the 5 by 5 field. 
Buffaloes start on top left. Buffaloes can only move to right, down, diagonally.
Your goal is to hit as many in a turn as possible and don't let them cross the field.
Otherwise you will lose if even one buffaloes gets to the bottom right corner ( 5, 5)
